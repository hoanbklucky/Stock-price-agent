This stock price agent was built based on this Youtube tutorial https://youtu.be/RFFcBkSupxk?si=iAMRKFpRvp_vWw4-
For deployment on Agent Engine, run deploy.ipynb, which I created based on this link https://google.github.io/adk-docs/deploy/agent-engine/
There are other documents about agent deployment:
